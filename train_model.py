# n_estimators is the number of decision trees the algorithm will build.
# random_state is a seed used by the random number generator, which ensures that the results are reproducible.
# max_leaf_nodes is the maximum number of leaf nodes in each decision tree.

# Use Model A (with max_leaf_nodes) if you care about :
# Faster inference
# Smaller model size
# Simpler model tuning (fewer trees)

# Use Model B (with max_depth) if you prefer:
# Potentially better generalization in larger or more complex datasets
# More flexible control over tree depth
